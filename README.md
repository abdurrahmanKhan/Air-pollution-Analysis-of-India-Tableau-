# Air-pollution-Analysis-of-India-Tableau-
In this project I have used India's air pollution data from 1987-2015 for analysing and finding out through analysis that which state, city and area(residential or industrial) are affected and are in need of attention.

Each worksheet is explained and in the end there is a final worksheet which allows you to see and coclude solutions through all the changes according to the respective fields provided

Fork and Star the repo then download and just run the cells for visualization.
